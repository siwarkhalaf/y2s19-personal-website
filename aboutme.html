	<h3>A story of a 16 y.o Palestinian photographer! : </h3>
	<p>So first of all, I am Siwar Khalaf,<b>a Palestinian photographer from Muqeibla village.</b>
		I like photography from my childhood, I used to take photos with iPhone 4s when I was 10 years old! I started taking photos of water and birds when I where in (hole) when I went with my famly.
		after that I continued taking simple photos with iPhone 4s and other mobile phones!
	</p>
	<p>
		When I was in 7th grade I went to my uncle <i>THE PHOTOGRAPHER KAREEM KHALAF</i>, and he tought me some bases of photography and I was going with him for photoshooting, I was taking photos with his Nikon camera Also.
		After that he saw that I have creativity, so he talked to my parents to buy for me a camera, so I bought Nikon d3400.
		I started taking photos with it for my friends and family, and tought my friend some of the things that I know, because life is nothing without learning from others!
		then I became a known photographer in my village, a lot of people started saying to me that ma photos are really beautiful, so I made a page on Instagram and started taking photos of people who send me that they want, and started photoshootings in the holidays and a lot of people came and supported me.
		from two years till now I do every holiday photo sessions with a lot of decorations.
	</p>
	<p>Till now, photographyis everything in my life, even if it's with a phone not just a camera.</p>
	<p>and in the end I just want to say: <strong>Do What You LOVE, LOVE What You Do!! & never copy others, you can be inspired, but DON'T COPY! Just always be you :)</strong></p>
